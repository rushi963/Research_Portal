# Database facilitating Student-Professor Research Interaction



This project focuses on Database design and implementation for a Research Portal. In any educational institute, students are always on the lookout for various research opportunities. However the information is difficult to get, often scattered, not monitored or updated frequently. Also, professors who have a good project might be on the lookout for interested students but might find it difficult to actually recruit students. This project aims to make a robust yet intuitive Database which is a centralized, reliable, up-to-date system to facilitate interaction amongst undergraduate, master and Ph.D students and professors. Many concepts of Database Management Systems like triggers, stored procedures, console interface have been used along with the usual insert, delete and select routines during the implementation.
